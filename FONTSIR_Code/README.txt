1. initialParams.m contains some initialization parameters, as well as the parameters of the system matrix.
 The parameters should be addressed carefully.
2. Demo.m is the start function of the algorithm.
3. chambolleAlgorithm3 stands for the solution part of sparsity.
4. getGM represents the part that looks for similarity patches.
5. TensorNuclear stands for the solution part of low-rank.
